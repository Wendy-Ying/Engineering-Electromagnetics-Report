# Engineering Electromagnetics Lab
The repository is the lab reports and source code in EE208 course "Engineering Electromagnetics". We use MATLAB to simulate information such as distributions and trajectories of electric and magnetic fields. At the same time, we used latex to write the lab report.

- lab1. Point charge electric field distribution
- lab2. Line charge electric field distribution
- lab3. Current ring magnetic field distribution
- lab4. Charge trajectory in an electromagnetic field
